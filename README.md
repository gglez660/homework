# homework

This is the read me file that I made in Linux using nano. Wow! So proud of myself. 
I am typing this at 12:16 AM in Luis' apt in San Francisco, off 317 Cornwall street
and I just returned from a self driving car taxi beta test from an app called Cruise.
I am very tired, but will be traveling to LA in a few hours! Very proud of this.

Sincerely, Gerardog
